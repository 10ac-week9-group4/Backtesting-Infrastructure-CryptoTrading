    "description": "This strategy uses the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) to determine when to buy and sell assets. The MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of an asset's price. When the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it generates a buy signal. When the MACD line crosses below the signal line, it generates a sell signal."
